# DiscordBot-Public-Build
A Fork of My Private Discord Bot

I created a private discord bot as my first capstone project and an intro into web development.
This public build exists as a template for friends, aquantainces, or anyone else who wants to create a discord bot with discord.py.
It contains the functionalities of my private bot but with most of the data removed as it was sensitive information.
The data libraries can easily be recreated with the templates left behind.
